        <h1>Product-Based Companies vs Service-Based Companies: A Guide for Developers</h1>

<h2>Product-Based Companies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Companies that own and offer digital products used by consumers (B2C) or businesses (B2B).</li>
  <li><strong>Examples:</strong> E-commerce, SaaS, EdTech, FinTech, Aggregators, etc.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Big Tech (FAANG/FAMAG/GAFAM/FAANGMULA)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>These companies dominate their markets and are known for their high-growth stocks.</li>
  <li>Employees often enjoy attractive compensation packages and opportunities for career advancement.</li>
  <li>Projects tend to be large-scale and innovative, with a focus on cutting-edge technologies.</li>
  <li>Examples include Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Uber, Flipkart, Adobe, Directi, Tower Research, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Top Product-Based Startups (Unicorns, Series B+)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Unicorns have valuations exceeding $1 billion and are often well-funded.</li>
  <li>Employees may have significant ownership stakes and opportunities for rapid career growth.</li>
  <li>Work environments can be dynamic and fast-paced, with a focus on innovation and disruption.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Service-Based Companies</h2>


<p>Service-Based Companies primarily offer engineering, design, and related services to other businesses. Unlike product-based companies, they don't develop their own products but rather sell the expertise and time of their employees to clients.</p>
<br/>
<p>In a service-based setup, the impact to effort ratio tends to be lower compared to product-based companies. Since employees are typically paid for their time rather than the direct impact they make on a product or service, the salary levels in service-based companies are often lower.</p>
<br/>
<p>Additionally, growth opportunities may be limited in service-based companies as advancement is tied to billable hours rather than the creation or improvement of proprietary products. This model can lead to slower career progression compared to product-based roles where employees have the opportunity to contribute directly to the development and success of a company's offerings.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Service-Based Startups (Dev Shops/Boutiques)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>These startups provide engineering and design services to other businesses.</li>

</ul>
