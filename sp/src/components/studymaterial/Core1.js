        <h1>Operating System Interview Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the difference between a process and a thread.</h2>
                <p>A process is an instance of a program that is being executed, whereas a thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can exist within the same process and share resources such as memory and file descriptors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is multitasking, and how does the operating system achieve it?</h2>
                <p>Multitasking is the ability of an operating system to execute multiple tasks concurrently. This can be achieved through time-sharing, where the CPU switches between executing tasks rapidly, giving the illusion of parallel execution.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Describe the difference between a kernel and a shell.</h2>
                <p>The kernel is the core component of an operating system that provides essential services such as process management, memory management, and device management. The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is virtual memory, and how does it work?</h2>
                <p>Virtual memory is a memory management technique that allows a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage. It works by dividing the virtual address space of a process into pages, which are then mapped to physical memory or disk storage as needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the concept of deadlock in operating systems.</h2>
                <p>Deadlock occurs when two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for another to release a resource. This situation can arise due to resource contention and improper resource allocation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What are the different scheduling algorithms used in operating systems?</h2>
                <p>Some common scheduling algorithms include First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin (RR), Priority Scheduling, and Shortest Remaining Time (SRT).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Describe the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.</h2>
                <p>Preemptive scheduling allows the operating system to interrupt a currently executing process to allocate CPU time to another process of higher priority. Non-preemptive scheduling, on the other hand, does not allow such interruptions and lets a process run until it voluntarily relinquishes the CPU.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>How does memory management work in an operating system?</h2>
                <p>Memory management involves allocating memory to processes, protecting memory from unauthorized access, and freeing memory when it is no longer needed. Techniques such as paging, segmentation, and virtual memory are used to manage memory efficiently.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is a file system, and what are its components?</h2>
                <p>A file system is a method used by operating systems to organize and store files on storage devices. Its components include directories (folders), files, file attributes (such as permissions and timestamps), and metadata (information about files and directories).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the role of device drivers in an operating system.</h2>
                <p>Device drivers are software components that allow the operating system to communicate with hardware devices such as printers, keyboards, and network adapters. They provide an interface between the hardware and the operating system, enabling the OS to control and manage hardware resources.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What are the different types of system calls, and how are they used?</h2>
                <p>System calls are functions provided by the operating system that can be called by user programs to perform tasks such as reading from or writing to files, creating processes, and managing memory. Some common types of system calls include file manipulation, process control, device manipulation, information maintenance, and communication.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Describe the boot process of a computer and the role of the operating system in it.</h2>
                <p>The boot process begins when the computer is powered on. The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) initializes hardware components and performs a Power-On Self-Test (POST). It then locates and loads the bootloader, which in turn loads the operating system kernel into memory. The operating system takes control of the system and initializes device drivers, launches system services, and presents the user with a login screen or desktop environment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is a semaphore, and how is it used for process synchronization?</h2>
                <p>A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming to control access to shared resources. It can be used to solve critical section problems and prevent race conditions by allowing only one process at a time to access a shared resource. Semaphores have two operations: wait (P) and signal (V).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the concept of paging and its advantages/disadvantages compared to segmentation.</h2>
                <p>Paging is a memory management scheme that divides physical memory into fixed-size blocks called pages and logical memory into fixed-size blocks called frames. It provides benefits such as simpler implementation, efficient use of memory, and ease of memory allocation and deallocation. However, it may suffer from internal fragmentation, where memory may be wasted due to incomplete use of page frames.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is a shell, and what are some commonly used shells in Unix-like operating systems?</h2>
                <p>A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. Commonly used shells in Unix-like operating systems include Bash (Bourne Again Shell), Zsh (Z Shell), KornShell (ksh), and C Shell (csh).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Discuss the difference between user-level threads and kernel-level threads.</h2>
                <p>User-level threads are managed entirely by the user-level thread library and do not require kernel support. They are fast to create and manage but may suffer from blocking if one thread in a process is blocked, all threads in the process are blocked. Kernel-level threads, on the other hand, are managed by the operating system kernel and are more efficient in terms of thread management and scheduling.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>How does an operating system handle interrupts?</h2>
                <p>When an interrupt occurs, the operating system suspends the currently executing process and transfers control to an interrupt handler routine. The interrupt handler services the interrupt by performing necessary actions, such as acknowledging the interrupt, saving the state of the interrupted process, and executing the appropriate interrupt service routine. Once the interrupt is handled, the operating system resumes the execution of the interrupted process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What are the differences between symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP)?</h2>
                <p>Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) is a multiprocessor computer architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single shared main memory and are controlled by a single operating system instance. Asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP), on the other hand, is a multiprocessor computer architecture where each processor is assigned a specific task or set of tasks, and there is no shared memory or single operating system instance controlling all processors.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the concept of deadlock prevention, avoidance, and detection.</h2>
                <p>Deadlock prevention involves ensuring that the conditions necessary for deadlock cannot occur. This can be achieved by using techniques such as resource ordering, where resources are allocated in a predefined order, and no process can request a resource if it holds a resource of a higher priority. Deadlock avoidance involves dynamically managing resource allocation to prevent deadlock from occurring. Deadlock detection involves periodically checking the system's state to identify if deadlock has occurred and then recovering from it by preempting resources or aborting processes.</p>

                <h2>What is the difference between a mutex and a semaphore?</h2>
                <p>A mutex is a synchronization primitive that allows only one thread to access a resource or a critical section at a time. It provides exclusive access to the resource and is typically used for mutual exclusion. A semaphore, on the other hand, is a synchronization primitive that allows multiple threads to access a shared resource or a critical section simultaneously. It can be used to control access to a pool of resources or implement synchronization between multiple processes.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the role of a page table in virtual memory management.</h2>
                <p>A page table is a data structure used by the operating system to map virtual addresses to physical addresses in virtual memory systems. It keeps track of the mapping between virtual pages and physical frames, allowing the operating system to translate virtual addresses generated by processes into corresponding physical addresses in main memory.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>What is thrashing, and how does the operating system prevent it?</h2>
                <p>Thrashing is a situation in virtual memory systems where the system spends more time swapping pages between main memory and disk than executing actual instructions. This occurs when the system is overloaded with too many processes, and there is insufficient memory to accommodate them all. The operating system can prevent thrashing by implementing techniques such as increasing the size of the page file, reducing the number of active processes, or optimizing the page replacement algorithm.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the difference between demand paging and swapping.</h2>
                <p>Demand paging is a memory management scheme where pages are loaded into memory only when they are needed, rather than being loaded all at once. It helps reduce the amount of memory required to run programs and improves system performance. Swapping, on the other hand, is a technique used by the operating system to move entire processes or parts of processes between main memory and disk storage to free up memory or make room for other processes. It is typically used when the system is low on memory.</p>
