        <p>Creating a compelling resume is essential for catching the attention of product-based companies. Here are some
            latest tips for crafting an impressive resume:</p>
    
        <h3>1. Tailor Your Resume to Each Job Application</h3>
        <p>Customize your resume for each job application to highlight the most relevant skills and experiences. Research
            the company and job requirements to align your resume with what the employer is looking for.</p>
    
        <h3>2. Use a Clean and Professional Format</h3>
        <p>Choose a clean and professional format that is easy to read and navigate. Use clear headings, bullet points,
            and consistent formatting throughout your resume. Avoid cluttered layouts and excessive use of fonts or colors.
        </p>
    
        <h3>3. Highlight Your Achievements and Impact</h3>
        <p>Focus on showcasing your achievements and the impact you've made in previous roles. Use quantifiable metrics and
            specific examples to demonstrate your contributions and accomplishments.</p>
    
        <h3>4. Prioritize Relevant Experience</h3>
        <p>Place greater emphasis on relevant experience that directly relates to the job you're applying for. Include
            details about projects, technologies, and responsibilities that demonstrate your suitability for the role.</p>
    
        <h3>5. Include Keywords from the Job Description</h3>
        <p>Optimize your resume with keywords and phrases from the job description to ensure it gets noticed by applicant
            tracking systems (ATS) and hiring managers. Use industry-specific terminology and buzzwords relevant to the
            role.</p>
    
        <h3>6. Showcase Your Technical Skills</h3>
        <p>Highlight your technical skills and proficiency with relevant tools, programming languages, frameworks, and
            technologies. Include a dedicated skills section or integrate them into your work experience and projects.</p>
    
        <h3>7. Provide Links to Portfolio or GitHub</h3>
        <p>If applicable, include links to your portfolio website, GitHub profile, or other online repositories where
            employers can view samples of your work and projects. Make sure these links are up-to-date and easily accessible
            from your resume.</p>
    
        <h3>8. Proofread and Edit Carefully</h3>
        <p>Thoroughly proofread and edit your resume to ensure it is free of spelling errors, grammatical mistakes, and
            typos. Consider seeking feedback from peers, mentors, or professional resume reviewers to catch any overlooked
            issues.</p>
    
        <h3>9. Keep Your Resume Concise</h3>
        <p>Avoid unnecessary details and keep your resume concise and focused. Aim for a one-page resume if possible,
            especially for early-career professionals. Prioritize quality over quantity when selecting information to
            include.</p>
    
        <h3>10. Update Your Resume Regularly</h3>
