        <h2>Let's break down the job search process into 4 phases:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Finding and submitting job applications</li>
          <li>Securing your resume's consideration</li>
          <li>Conquering interviews</li>
          <li>Receiving an offer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Let's delve into what's required at each stage.</p>
        <p>Note that substantial groundwork is necessary well before beginning the job hunt. Further details on this are outlined below.</p>

        <h2>Finding and submitting job applications</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Guidance on applying for off-campus positions (jobs/internships)</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Securing your resume's consideration</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Given that most job postings attract hundreds to thousands of applications, it's impractical for companies to interview every applicant.</li>
          <li>To streamline the interview process, recruiters and hiring managers shortlist resumes that stand out or closely align with job requirements.</li>
          <li>While having common foundational projects on your resume or a 3-star rating on CodeChef is advantageous, they won't set you apart as many other applicants possess similar credentials.</li>
          <li>Here are a few elements that can enhance your resume:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Strong performance in programming competitions</li>
            <li>Hands-on projects addressing real-world problems with unsearchable code</li>
            <li>Meaningful contributions to open-source projects</li>
            <li>Noteworthy research endeavors</li>
            <li>Attending a Tier-1 college (though this factor is often beyond your control)</li>
            <li>Prior employment at a prominent tech firm (not applicable to freshers)</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Ensure your resume adheres to best practices: Resume guidelines for product-based companies</li>
          <li>Feeling uncertain? Competitive Programming or Open Source Contribution?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conquering interviews</h2>
        <p>Note that two aspects are pivotal here:</p>

          <li><strong>Practice:</strong> Devoting significant time to practical exercises to master learned concepts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Developing coding skills & establishing a solid foundation</h3>
        <ul>
