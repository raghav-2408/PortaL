        <h1>How to Solve a DSA Problem on Online Coding Platforms</h1>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Understand the Problem:</strong> Read the problem statement carefully and make sure you understand what it's asking for. Identify the input constraints, the expected output, and any special cases mentioned.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Example Input/Output:</strong> Take a few minutes to work through example inputs and outputs. This helps you understand the problem better and gives you a clear idea of what your code needs to accomplish. 
      <ul>
    
        <li><strong>Example 1:</strong> Given an array of integers, find the maximum subarray sum. <br/> Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4] <br/> Output: 6 (corresponding to the subarray [4, -1, 2, 1])</li>
        <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Given a binary tree, find the maximum depth of the tree. <br/> Input: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7] <br/> Output: 3</li>
    
</ul>
    </li>
    
    <li><strong>Clarify Doubts:</strong> If you have any doubts about the problem statement, reach out to the community forums provided by these platforms. Often, there are discussions or clarifications available that can help you understand the problem better.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Identify the Algorithmic Approach:</strong> Based on your understanding of the problem, try to identify the most suitable algorithmic approach. Common techniques include brute force, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, divide and conquer, etc.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Write Pseudocode:</strong> Before jumping into coding, it's helpful to outline your approach in pseudocode. This step helps you organize your thoughts and ensures that you have a clear plan before you start writing actual code.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Implement the Solution:</strong> Write your code in the language of your choice. Start by translating your pseudocode into actual code. Pay attention to edge cases and handle them appropriately.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Test Your Code:</strong> After writing your code, test it thoroughly with different test cases, including edge cases and large inputs if applicable. Verify that your code produces the correct output for all scenarios.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Optimize (If Necessary):</strong> Once you have a working solution, analyze its time and space complexity. If your solution is not optimal, try to optimize it. This may involve refining your algorithm or using more efficient data structures.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Submit and Review:</strong> Once you're confident in your solution, submit it on the platform. Take some time to review your code and ensure that it's well-structured and easy to understand. Document your code with comments if necessary.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Learn from Others:</strong> After submitting your solution, take some time to explore other submissions, especially those that are highly rated or provide alternative approaches. Learning from others' solutions can broaden your understanding and improve your problem-solving skills.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Practice Regularly:</strong> DSA is a skill that improves with practice. Make it a habit to solve problems regularly on these platforms to sharpen your skills and stay prepared for coding interviews or competitive programming contests.</li>

  <h1>Example Problem: Maximum Subarray Sum</h1>

<p>Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.</p>

<h2>1. Brute Force Approach:</h2>
<p>Iterate through all possible subarrays and calculate their sums. Return the maximum sum found.</p>
<p>Time Complexity: O(n^2)</p>
<p>Space Complexity: O(1)</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def max_subarray_brute_force(nums):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i, len(nums)):
            current_sum = sum(nums[i:j+1])
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

# Example usage:
nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
print(max_subarray_brute_force(nums))  # Output: 6
</code></pre>

<h2>2. Kadane's Algorithm (Optimal Approach):</h2>
<p>Initialize two variables, <code>max_sum</code> and <code>current_sum</code>, to the first element of the array. Iterate through the array, updating <code>current_sum</code> by adding the current element or starting a new subarray if the current element is greater than the sum of the previous subarray. Update <code>max_sum</code> if <code>current_sum</code> is greater. Return <code>max_sum</code>.</p>
<p>Time Complexity: O(n)</p>
<p>Space Complexity: O(1)</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def max_subarray_kadane(nums):
    max_sum = nums[0]
    current_sum = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

# Example usage:
nums = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
print(max_subarray_kadane(nums))  # Output: 6
