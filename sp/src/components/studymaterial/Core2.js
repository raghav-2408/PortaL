                <h2>What is a DBMS, and why is it important?</h2>
                <p>A DBMS is a software system that enables users to define, create, maintain, and control access to databases. It is important because it provides a structured way to organize and manage large volumes of data efficiently, ensuring data integrity, security, and reliability.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What are the different types of DBMS models?</h2>
                <p>The main types of DBMS models include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Relational Model</li>
                        <li>Hierarchical Model</li>
                        <li>Network Model</li>
                        <li>Object-Oriented Model</li>
                        <li>Document Model</li>
                        <li>Key-Value Model</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the difference between a database and a DBMS.</h2>
                <p>A database is an organized collection of data, while a DBMS is a software system used to manage, manipulate, and interact with databases.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is a primary key, and why is it important in a database?</h2>
                <p>A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that each record can be uniquely identified and helps maintain data integrity by preventing duplicate or null values in the key column.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is normalization, and why is it important in database design?</h2>
                <p>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It helps eliminate data anomalies and ensures that the database design is efficient, scalable, and easy to maintain.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What are the ACID properties in DBMS?</h2>
                <p>ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These properties ensure that database transactions are processed reliably:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Atomicity: Transactions are treated as a single unit of work and either complete entirely or not at all.</li>
                        <li>Consistency: Transactions bring the database from one consistent state to another consistent state.</li>
                        <li>Isolation: Transactions are executed independently of each other, ensuring that the outcome of one transaction does not affect the outcome of another.</li>
                        <li>Durability: Once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and remain in the database even in the event of system failure.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is a foreign key, and how does it relate to a primary key?</h2>
                <p>A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, enforcing referential integrity and ensuring data consistency.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index.</h2>
                <p>In a clustered index, the physical order of rows in the table is the same as the order of rows in the index. In a non-clustered index, the physical order of rows in the table is independent of the order of rows in the index. Each table can have only one clustered index, but multiple non-clustered indexes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is a transaction, and what are its properties?</h2>
                <p>A transaction is a logical unit of work that consists of one or more database operations. It must satisfy the ACID properties:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Atomicity: The transaction is treated as a single unit of work.</li>
                        <li>Consistency: The transaction brings the database from one consistent state to another.</li>
                        <li>Isolation: The transaction's operations are isolated from other transactions.</li>
                        <li>Durability: Once the transaction is committed, its effects are permanent.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the difference between a join and a subquery.</h2>
                <p>A join is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. A subquery is a query nested within another query and is used to retrieve data based on a condition evaluated against the result of the outer query.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is data redundancy, and how can it be minimized?</h2>
                <p>Data redundancy refers to the unnecessary repetition of data in a database. It can be minimized through normalization, where data is organized to reduce redundancy by breaking down tables into smaller, more manageable pieces and establishing relationships between them.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is a stored procedure, and how does it differ from a function?</h2>
                <p>A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed repeatedly by calling the procedure's name. Unlike functions, stored procedures can perform data manipulation and transaction control operations, and they can also accept input parameters and return multiple values.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the concept of database normalization and its different normal forms.</h2>
                <p>Database normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. The different normal forms include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First Normal Form (1NF)</li>
                        <li>Second Normal Form (2NF)</li>
                        <li>Third Normal Form (3NF)</li>
                        <li>Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)</li>
                        <li>Fourth Normal Form (4NF)</li>
                        <li>Fifth Normal Form (5NF)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is indexing, and why is it used in databases?</h2>
                <p>Indexing is the process of creating an index on one or more columns in a database table to improve the speed of data retrieval operations. It is used to quickly locate rows that match a specified condition and can significantly reduce the time required to search for data in large tables.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the concept of a view in a database.</h2>
                <p>A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT query. It does not store data itself but provides a way to present data from one or more tables in a predefined format. Views can simplify complex queries, enforce security restrictions, and provide a consistent interface to users.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is data integrity, and how is it maintained in a database?</h2>
                <p>Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data stored in a database. It is maintained through various mechanisms such as constraints (e.g., primary key, foreign key, unique key), referential integrity rules, and data validation checks to ensure that only valid and accurate data is stored in the database.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>What is a trigger, and how is it used in a database?</h2>
                <p>A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that is automatically executed (fired) in response to certain database events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table. Triggers can be used to enforce data integrity rules, perform logging, or automate complex data processing tasks.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the concept of database indexing and its advantages.</h2>
                <p>Database indexing is the process of creating an index on one or more columns in a database table to improve the speed of data retrieval operations. The advantages of indexing include faster query execution, efficient data retrieval, and improved overall performance of database operations, especially for large tables.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>What is the difference between a clustered and a non-clustered index?</h2>
                <p>In a clustered index, the physical order of rows in the table is the same as the order of rows in the index. In a non-clustered index, the physical order of rows in the table is independent of the order of rows in the index. Each table can have only one clustered index, but multiple non-clustered indexes.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>What is the purpose of database normalization?</h2>
                <p>The purpose of database normalization is to organize data in a database in such a way as to reduce redundancy and dependency, thereby improving data integrity and minimizing the chances of data anomalies. Normalization involves breaking down large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces and establishing relationships between them.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>What are the different levels of database normalization?</h2>
                <p>The different levels of database normalization, known as normal forms, include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First Normal Form (1NF)</li>
                        <li>Second Normal Form (2NF)</li>
                        <li>Third Normal Form (3NF)</li>
                        <li>Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)</li>
                        <li>Fourth Normal Form (4NF)</li>
                        <li>Fifth Normal Form (5NF)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>What is denormalization, and when is it used?</h2>
                <p>Denormalization is the process of intentionally introducing redundancy into a database design to improve performance by reducing the need for joins and increasing query execution speed. It is typically used in scenarios where read performance is more critical than write performance or when dealing with complex queries that involve multiple joins.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is a database schema?</h2>
                <p>A database schema is a collection of database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, stored procedures, and triggers, along with their relationships and constraints. It defines the logical structure of the database and provides a blueprint for how data is organized and accessed.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>What is the difference between a DELETE and a TRUNCATE statement?</h2>
                <p>A DELETE statement is used to remove rows from a table based on a specified condition, whereas a TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table without any condition. DELETE operations are logged and can be rolled back, while TRUNCATE operations are not logged and cannot be rolled back.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>What is a deadlock in a database, and how can it be prevented?</h2>
                <p>A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for resources held by each other, preventing any of them from progressing. Deadlocks can be prevented by implementing techniques such as deadlock detection and resolution, using appropriate locking mechanisms (e.g., row-level locking), and ensuring that transactions acquire locks in a consistent order.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>Explain the concept of database normalization and its benefits.</h2>
                <p>Database normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency, thereby improving data integrity and minimizing the chances of data anomalies. The benefits of normalization include better data organization, reduced data redundancy, improved data consistency, and easier database maintenance and updates.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>What is a stored procedure, and why is it used?</h2>
                <p>A stored procedure is a precompiled set of SQL statements that is stored in the database and can be executed repeatedly by calling the procedure's name. Stored procedures are used to encapsulate complex business logic, improve performance by reducing network traffic, enhance security by controlling access to data, and promote code reusability and maintainability.</p>
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using stored procedures?</h2>
                <p>The advantages of using stored procedures include improved performance, reduced network traffic, enhanced security, code encapsulation, code reuse, and easier maintenance and updates. However, stored procedures can also introduce complexity, reduce portability, increase development and testing effort, and limit flexibility compared to dynamic SQL queries.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>What is data redundancy, and how can it be minimized?</h2>
