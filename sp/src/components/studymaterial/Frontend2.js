        <h1>Top JavaScript Interview Questions and Answers</h1>

        <h2>1. What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. It is widely used for client-side web development and can also be used server-side with frameworks like Node.js.</p>
    
        <h2>2. What are the key features of JavaScript?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dynamic Typing</li>
            <li>Prototype-based inheritance</li>
            <li>First-class functions</li>
            <li>Closures</li>
            <li>Asynchronous programming with callbacks and promises</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>3. What is the difference between '=='' and '===' operators in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>The '==' operator checks for equality after performing type coercion, whereas the '===' operator checks for equality without type coercion (strict equality).</p>
    
        <h2>4. Explain hoisting in JavaScript.</h2>
        <p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.</p>
    
        <h2>5. What are closures in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>A closure is a combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. It allows a function to access variables from its outer scope even after the outer function has finished executing.</p>
    
        <h2>6. Explain the event bubbling and event capturing in JavaScript.</h2>
        <p>Event bubbling is the process where an event propagates from the target element up through its ancestors in the DOM tree. Event capturing, on the other hand, is the oppositeâ€”it involves capturing events at the root and propagating down to the target element.</p>
    
        <h2>7. What is the 'this' keyword in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>The 'this' keyword refers to the object that owns the JavaScript code currently being executed. It provides a way to access object properties and methods within a function or method.</p>
    
        <h2>8. What is a callback function?</h2>
        <p>A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.</p>
    
        <h2>9. What is event delegation in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a parent element to listen for events that occur on its descendant elements. This is useful for handling events on dynamically created or large numbers of elements efficiently.</p>
    
        <h2>10. Explain the difference between 'null' and 'undefined' in JavaScript.</h2>
        <p>'null' represents the intentional absence of any object value, whereas 'undefined' represents a variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.</p>
        <h2>11. What is the event loop in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that allows asynchronous tasks to be executed in a non-blocking manner. It continuously checks the call stack and the callback queue, pushing asynchronous tasks from the callback queue onto the call stack when the call stack is empty.</p>

    <h2>12. How does prototypal inheritance work in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>Prototypal inheritance is a way of creating objects in JavaScript where objects inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object has a prototype object, and when a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript looks for it in the object itself and its prototype chain.</p>

    <h2>13. Explain the difference between 'let', 'const', and 'var' in JavaScript.</h2>
    <p>'var' is function-scoped and can be redeclared and reassigned, 'let' is block-scoped and cannot be redeclared but can be reassigned, and 'const' is also block-scoped and cannot be redeclared or reassigned after initialization.</p>

    <h2>14. What are arrow functions in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>Arrow functions are a concise way to write anonymous functions in JavaScript. They have a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions and lexically bind the 'this' value, meaning they inherit the 'this' value from the surrounding code.</p>

    <h2>15. Explain the concept of promises in JavaScript.</h2>
    <p>Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. Promises can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected, and allow chaining of asynchronous operations using 'then()' and 'catch()' methods.</p>
    <h2>16. What is the difference between 'null' and 'undefined' in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>'null' represents the intentional absence of any object value, whereas 'undefined' represents a variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.</p>

    <h2>17. What is the purpose of the 'use strict' directive in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>The 'use strict' directive enables strict mode in JavaScript, which helps catch common coding errors and provides better error handling. It enforces stricter parsing and error handling rules, preventing the use of certain features and practices that are considered bad practice or deprecated.</p>

    <h2>18. Explain the difference between 'document.ready()' and 'window.onload()' in JavaScript.</h2>
    <p>The 'document.ready()' event is triggered when the DOM is fully loaded, while the 'window.onload()' event is triggered when all the content on the page, including images and other external resources, is fully loaded.</p>

    <h2>19. What is the purpose of the 'defer' attribute in a script tag?</h2>
    <p>The 'defer' attribute in a script tag tells the browser to defer the execution of the script until after the document has been parsed. This can help improve page load performance by allowing other resources to load in parallel while the script is being fetched.</p>

    <h2>20. How do you handle errors in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>Errors in JavaScript can be handled using try-catch blocks, where code that may throw an error is enclosed within a 'try' block and any resulting errors are caught and handled in the 'catch' block. Additionally, you can use 'throw' to manually throw custom errors.</p>

    <h2>21. What is the difference between 'null' and 'undefined' in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>'null' represents the intentional absence of any object value, whereas 'undefined' represents a variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.</p>

    <h2>22. What is the purpose of the 'use strict' directive in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>The 'use strict' directive enables strict mode in JavaScript, which helps catch common coding errors and provides better error handling. It enforces stricter parsing and error handling rules, preventing the use of certain features and practices that are considered bad practice or deprecated.</p>

    <h2>23. Explain the difference between 'document.ready()' and 'window.onload()' in JavaScript.</h2>
    <p>The 'document.ready()' event is triggered when the DOM is fully loaded, while the 'window.onload()' event is triggered when all the content on the page, including images and other external resources, is fully loaded.</p>

    <h2>24. What is the purpose of the 'defer' attribute in a script tag?</h2>
    <p>The 'defer' attribute in a script tag tells the browser to defer the execution of the script until after the document has been parsed. This can help improve page load performance by allowing other resources to load in parallel while the script is being fetched.</p>

    <h2>25. How do you handle errors in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>Errors in JavaScript can be handled using try-catch blocks, where code that may throw an error is enclosed within a 'try' block and any resulting errors are caught and handled in the 'catch' block. Additionally, you can use 'throw' to manually throw custom errors.</p>

    <h2>26. What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>There are several types of errors in JavaScript, including SyntaxError, ReferenceError, TypeError, RangeError, and more. SyntaxError occurs when there is a syntax error in the code, ReferenceError occurs when trying to reference an undefined variable, TypeError occurs when a value is not of the expected type, and RangeError occurs when a value is not in the set or range of allowed values.</p>

    <h2>27. What are the benefits of using JavaScript modules?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript modules provide a way to organize code into reusable units with explicit dependencies and exports. They help improve code maintainability, reusability, and scalability by encapsulating functionality and reducing namespace pollution.</p>

    <h2>28. How can you compare two objects in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, objects are compared by reference, not by value. Therefore, two objects are considered equal only if they reference the same underlying object. To compare the values of two objects, you would need to manually compare their properties.</p>

    <h2>29. What are the different ways to create objects in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>There are several ways to create objects in JavaScript, including object literals, constructor functions, the 'Object.create()' method, and ES6 classes. Each method has its own advantages and use cases.</p>

    <h2>30. What is the purpose of the 'async' and 'await' keywords in JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>The 'async' and 'await' keywords are used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations more easily and synchronously. 'async' is used to define a function that returns a promise, while 'await' is used to pause the execution of an async function until a promise is settled (fulfilled or rejected), and to return the resolved value of the promise.</p>
